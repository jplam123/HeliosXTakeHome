## Trade offs/Could dos
Due to the time limited nature of this exercise, I did not have time to do everything that I would have liked to achieve,
firstly making the answer class have subclasses this helps obey SOLID, this way it could better handle numeric questions.
I would have liked to have stored more information, rather than having it in memory, this would make the entity relationships more distinct.

Hard coding the eligibility logic, makes it straightforward to understand, and easy to modify for engineers.
But a mechanism that takes a JSON or database to figure out what is an acceptable answer may make it easy to extend up on in the future. 
So if this was a production level application this may be the approach I would go for. 

I used a unique generated primary key, this leads into more flexibility if the primary key could change, and do to my experience dealing with JPA.
With a primary key of Question Id + Answer Id we woudl ensure data integrity at the database level, rather than manually checking.
